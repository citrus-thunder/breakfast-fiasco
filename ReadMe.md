#Breakfast Fiasco

A simple game made in Godot as a gift to my wife. Based loosely on a scene in one of her projects-in-progress

Stop the eggs from hitting the floor by moving the dragon to catch the eggs. Fall rates are random, so if you drop them right away don't worry! You'll do better next time.

Left/Right arrow keys to move.

You can play this game right in-browser on my website [right here](http://m-r-williams.com/extras/breakfast-game/play/), or download it [here](http://m-r-williams.com/extras/breakfast-game).

The game was made somewhat quickly so I'm sure there's improvements to be had. Recommendations are welcome, but expect the code to clean itself up over time as I tidy it up!
